# OmNu-Ice Dark
This Numix clone is the dark version of OmNu-Ice. It features a dark and cool color scheme.

For this theme, I added a few styling adjustments to make it more modern.

## How to Install

1. Download the latest file from the [downloads](https://github.com/jgpws/omnu-ice-dark/tree/main/downloads) directory
2. Open a Terminal application
3. Navigate to your Downloads folder in the terminal (usually titled Downloads). Type `cd Downloads`
4. Type `ls` and look for `omnu-ice-dark-month-day-year.tar.gz`, where month, day and year represent when the file was last updated
5. Untar the file by typing `tar -zxvf omnu-ice-dark-MM-DD-YY.tar.gz`, substituting the current version's date numbers
6. type `cd` again to get to your home folder; type `ls -a` and see if there is a **.themes** directory
7. If one does not exist, create one: `mkdir .themes`
8. `cd Downloads`
9. `cp OmNu-Ice-dark ../.themes`

### To install OmNu-Ice Dark globally:

1. Follow steps 1-5 above
2. `cd /usr/share/themes`
3. `sudo cp -r ~/Downloads/OmNu-Ice-dark /usr/share/themes`
4. Enter sudo password
5. `ls` to check that the theme folder is present
